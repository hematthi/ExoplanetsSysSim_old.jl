##### NOTE: must run this script from the same directory in which you want to submit the jobs from!

##### To actually write a number of PBS scripts and submit them:

job_basename = "optimize_job" #base name for the job to be submitted
n_submits = 20 #total number of jobs to submit

for i in 1:n_submits
    write_pbs(job_basename, i)
    job_name = job_basename*"_"*string(i)*".pbs"
    run(`qsub $job_name`) #this line submits the job by running 'qsub' in the command line!
    #println(`qsub $job_name`) #this line is just to see what the command looks like in the command line
    println("Job ", i, " submitted.")
